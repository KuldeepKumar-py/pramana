/**
 * \class Domain
 * \brief Singleton class that stores and manages all domain-specific
 * information for the planner.
 *
 * The Domain class is responsible for reading, storing, and processing all
 * relevant information about the planning domain from the input file. This
 * includes fluents, actions, agents, initial State descriptions, and goal
 * conditions. The class ensures that all domain data is available in structured
 * form for the rest of the planner.
 *
 * This class follows the Singleton pattern: only one instance exists during the
 * application's lifetime. All access to domain data should be performed through
 * this single instance.
 *
 * \note The domain is initialized once at startup, and its data remains
 * constant throughout execution.
