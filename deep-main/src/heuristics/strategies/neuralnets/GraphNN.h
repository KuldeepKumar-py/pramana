 * \struct GraphTensor
 * \brief Represents a graph in tensor format for input to a Graph Neural
 * Network (GNN) using ONNX.
 *
 * This structure encapsulates the graph as a set of arrays:
 * - edge_src: 1D array of symbolic source node IDs for each edge.
 * - edge_dst: 1D array of symbolic destination node IDs for each edge.
 * - edge_attrs: 1D array of edge attributes or labels, aligned with edges.
 * - real_node_ids: 1D array mapping symbolic node IDs to their corresponding
 * - real_node_ids_bitmask: flatten multiDim array mapping symbolic node IDs to
 * their corresponding BITMASK IDs.
 *
 * All arrays are designed for compatibility with ONNX Runtime and GNN models
 * exported to ONNX format.
