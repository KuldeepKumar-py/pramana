/**
 * \class SatisfiedGoals
 * \brief Implements the heuristic "number of satisfied sub-goals".
 *
 * \details This class checks how many sub-goals (elements of \ref
 * Domain::get_instance().get_goal_description()) each state satisfies and
 * selects the states that satisfy the highest number of sub-goals for
 * expansion.
 *
 * As an extension, complex belief formulas can be broken into multiple
 * components for more sub-goals and accuracy. For example, \ref C_FORMULA can
 * be split into multiple components.
